#Supply Chain Technology Final Project - Team Chain Reaction

## Project Overview
#Our data is about export trade from multiple countries, but focused on trade from country A to country B in said year. The data set also included how much money in USD was being traded between country A and country B in said year. We want to know, which trade partners or commodities are most critical to global supply chains?

We used AI to help us with our coding and visualization.

     ## Deliverables
     # Deliverable 1
To choose the kind of prediction model, first, we had to look at our dataset. Our dataset covers export trade from multiple countries, while focusing on trade from Country A to Country B. Our goal is to identify which trade partners or commodities are most critical to global supply chains.

The link below gives an overview of every prediction model. After reviewing the pros and cons of every model and comparing it to the dataset, we decided that a time series model would be the best fit for us and our project. 

A time series model is the best fit for our trade data because it looks at how things change over time. Our data shows how much money was traded between country A and country B each year, so itâ€™s already set up in a way that works well with this kind of model. Time series models help you see patterns, like if trade is going up, going down, or changing with the seasons. They can also spot big changes caused by world events, like new laws or supply chain problems.

Unlike simple averages, which just give you one number, time series models can show how trade is growing or shrinking. They can also make better guesses about the future. Since our data includes many countries and products, this model can help us look at all of them at once and find out which ones are most important. That way, you can figure out which trade partners or goods matter most to the global supply chain and where problems might show up.

 ## Deliverable 2
#We are choosing to use AI Implementation for our project.
For our Anylogic model this is what each of our blocks represent:
Source - Reporter Name
Queue - Sorting Items By Value
Service - TransitTime (Days)
Sink - Partner Name

The portion we think makes the most sense to use AI/Machine learning is the lead time estimate. This is because the variable we are measuring is the transit time. We are evaluating the time it took for items to travel from Country A to Country B and the time it takes varies. If we were able to predict the lead time estimate that would be beneficial to all of the countries.
