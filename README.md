#Supply Chain Technology Final Project - Team Chain Reaction

## Project Overview
#Our data is about export trade from multiple countries, but focused on trade from country A to country B in said year. The data set also included how much money in USD was being traded between country A and country B in said year. We want to know, which trade partners or commodities are most critical to global supply chains?
